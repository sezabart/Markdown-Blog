# Markdown-Blog

Markdown-Blog is a lightweight FastHTML server designed to automatically display blog posts based on directories within a specified content path. Each directory represents a blog, and any markdown files within the directory are treated as blog content. Images and other assets of the blog should be stored in the directory.

## Features

- Automatically detects and serves blog posts from directories.
- Supports markdown files for blog content.
- Serves images and other assets from the same directory as the markdown files.
